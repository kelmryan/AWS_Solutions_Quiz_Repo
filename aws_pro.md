### You are implementing AWS Direct Connect. You intend to use AWS public service end points such as Amazon S3, across the AWS Direct Connect link. You want other Internet traffic to use your existing link to an Internet Service Provider. What is the correct way to configure AWS Direct connect for access to services such as Amazon S3?

- [ ] A. Configure a public Interface on your AWS Direct Connect link. Configure a static route via your AWS Direct Connect link that points to Amazon S3 Advertise a default route to AWS using BGP.
- [ ] B. Create a private interface on your AWS Direct Connect link. Configure a static route via your AWS Direct connect link that points to Amazon S3 Configure specific routes to your network in your VPC.
- [x] C. Create a public interface on your AWS Direct Connect link. Redistribute BGP routes into your existing routing infrastructure; advertise specific routes for your network to AWS.
- [ ] D. Create a private interface on your AWS Direct connect link. Redistribute BGP routes into your existing routing infrastructure and advertise a default route to AWS.


### Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence. The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads. To improve performance you recently added a single-node Memcached ElastiCache Cluster to cache frequent DB query results. In the next weeks the overall workload is expected to grow by 30%. Do you need to change anything in the architecture to maintain the high availability or the application with the anticipated additional load? Why?

- [x] A. Yes, you should deploy two Memcached ElastiCache Clusters in different AZs because the RDS instance will not be able to handle the load if the cache node fails.
- [ ] B. No, if the cache node fails you can always get the same data from the DB without having any availability impact. 
- [ ] C. No, if the cache node fails the automated ElastiCache node recovery feature will prevent any availability impact. 
- [ ] D. Yes, you should deploy the Memcached ElastiCache Cluster with two nodes in the same AZ as the RDS DB master instance to handle the load if one cache node fails.

### A company is hosting a critical application on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The application uses an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis single-node cluster for an in-memory data store. The application uses an Amazon RDS for MariaDB DB instance for a relational database. For the application to function, each piece of the infrastructure must be healthy and must be in an active state. A solutions architect needs to improve the application's architecture so that the infrastructure can automatically recover from failure with the least possible downtime. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)
 - [x] A. Use an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Ensure that the EC2 instances are part of an Auto Scaling group that has a minimum capacity of two instances. 
 - [ ] B. Use an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Ensure that the EC2 instances are configured in unlimited mode.
 - [ ] C. Modify the DB instance to create a read replica in the same Availability Zone. Promote the read replica to be the primary DB instance in failure scenarios.
 - [x] D. Modify the DB instance to create a Multi-AZ deployment that extends across two Availability Zones.
 - [ ] E. Create a replication group for the ElastiCache for Redis cluster. Configure the cluster to use an Auto Scaling group that has a minimum capacity of two instances.
 - [x] F. Create a replication group for the ElastiCache for Redis cluster. Enable Multi-AZ on the cluster.

### A company has many AWS accounts and uses AWS Organizations to manage all of them. A solutions architect must implement a solution that the company can use to share a common network across multiple accounts. The companyâ€™s infrastructure team has a dedicated infrastructure account that has a VPC. The infrastructure team must use this account to manage the network. Individual accounts cannot have the ability to manage their own networks. However, individual accounts must be able to create AWS resources within subnets. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect perform to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- [ ] A. Create a transit gateway in the infrastructure account. 
- [x] B. Enable resource sharing from the AWS Organizations management account.
- [ ] C. Create VPCs in each AWS account within the organization in AWS Organizations. Configure the VPCs to share the same CIDR range and subnets as the VPC in the infrastructure account. Peer the VPCs in each individual account with the VPC in the infrastructure account.
- [x] D. Create a resource share in AWS Resource Access Manager in the infrastructure account. Select the specific AWS Organizations OU that will use the shared network. Select each subnet to associate with the resource share.
- [ ] E. Create a resource share in AWS Resource Access Manager in the infrastructure account. Select the specific AWS Organizations OU that will use the shared network. Select each prefix list to associate with the resource share.

### You are designing Internet connectivity for your VPC. The Web servers must be available on the Internet. The application must have a highly available architecture. Which alternatives should you consider? (Choose two.)

- [ ]  Configure a NAT instance in your VPC. Create a default route via the NAT instance and associate it with all subnets. Configure a DNS A record that points to the NAT instance public IP address.
- [ ]  Configure a CloudFront distribution and configure the origin to point to the private IP addresses of your Web servers. Configure a Route53 CNAME record to your CloudFront distribution.
- [x]  C. Place all your web servers behind ELB. Configure a Route53 CNMIE to point to the ELB DNS name.
- [x]  D. Assign EIPs to all web servers. Configure a Route53 record set with all EIPs, with health checks and DNS failover.
- [ ]  E. Configure ELB with an EIP. Place all your Web servers behind ELB. Configure a Route53 A record that points to the EIP.
  
###  You are tasked with moving a legacy application from a virtual machine running Inside your datacenter to an Amazon VPC. Unfortunately this app requires access to a number of on-premises services and no one who configured the app still works for your company. Even worse there's no documentation for it. What will allow the application running inside the VPC to reach back and access its internal dependencies without being reconfigured? (Choose three.)
- [x] A. An AWS Direct Connect link between the VPC and the network housing the internal services.
- [ ] B. An Internet Gateway to allow a VPN connection.
- [ ] C. An Elastic IP address on the VPC instance
- [x] D. An IP address space that does not conflict with the one on-premises
- [x] E. Entries in Amazon Route 53 that allow the Instance to resolve its dependencies' IP addresses
- [ ] F. A VM Import of the current virtual machine
